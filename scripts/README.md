# ak2272/Codes/Matlab_scripts directory structure
---
This short readme file explains the structure of the ak2272/Codes/Matlab_scripts directory that stores all the Matlab scripts of my project. Below is a list of directories and files along with a description of what they contain:

1. **Alignment** - This directory contains all the scripts that I implemented for my first attempt in aligning the scans from different fishes using a combination of deep learning and dynamic programming.
2. **Check_up** - This directory contains a few scripts that I implemented to perform check ups.  
3. **Compression** - This directory contains all the scripts that I implemented for compression.  
4. **GeneAssociation** - This directory contains all the scripts that I implemented to analyse the association file output from GEMMA and ANGSD to sort, filter, and plot SNPs. 
5. **Measurements** - This directory contains all the scripts that I implemented for the deep learning model to extract phenotypic traits from the CT-data. 
6. **Pre-processing** - This directory contains all the scripts that I implemented to pre-process images.
