# DLP (Deep Learning Phenotyper) package  
---
The DLP package phenotypes morphological variation of vertebrates using deep learning and CT scan image datasets. The model uses Resnet50 pre-trained along with a tunable Fully Connected layer and a linear SVM that can be customised based on the application at hand. This README file briefly introduces the scripts and how they can be used. For a more comprehensive guideline, please see the comments in each of the scripts.

## Repository contents 
---
Description of the directories in this repositories are provided below:

1. **Matlab_scripts** - This directory contains all the Matlab scripts that I implemented for deep learning method, pre-processing, and figure generation. 
2. **R_scripts** - This directory contains all the R scripts that I implemented for GWAS analysis and figure generation.  
3. **Shell_scripts** - This directory contains some of the shell scripts that I used for job submissions. I included these so it would be easier to submit jobs to the CSD.
